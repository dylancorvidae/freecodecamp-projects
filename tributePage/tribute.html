        Fred Rogers was many thing to many people and is most well-known for his television show Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood. But to me Fred Rogers was a caretaker. He was an adult I could trust and love and the one person that told me as a child that I was good enough to love exactly as I was and that I didn't have to do anything for him or be anybody other than myself to be loved. That message all by itself is profound and still to this day I can watch Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and cry because what he says affects me deeply on an emotional level.  You can find a lot more information on the Fred Rogers Wikipedia page found<a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers">here</a>.
